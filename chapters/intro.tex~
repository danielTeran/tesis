Gene finding is an important application of comparative genomics, as is discovery of new, non-codingfunctional elements of the genome. Comparative genomics exploits both similarities and differences in the proteins,RNA, and regulatory regions of different organisms. Computational approaches to genome comparison haverecently become a common research topic in computer science. Analysis of mutations in cancer In cancer, the genomes of affected cells are rearranged in complex or even unpredictable ways. Massive sequencingefforts are used to identify previously unknown point mutations in a variety of genes in cancer. Bioinformaticianscontinue to produce specialized automated systems to manage the sheer volume of sequence data produced, and theycreate new algorithms and software to compare the sequencing results to the growing collection of human genomesequences and germline polymorphisms. New physical detection technologies are employed, such as oligonucleotidemicroarrays to identify chromosomal gains and losses and single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to detect knownpoint mutations. Another type of data that requires novel informatics development is the analysis of lesions found tobe recurrent among many tumors. *-Redes de regulaci—n transcripciones -importancia en biolog’a y biomedicina. -Miner’a de datos en bioinform‡tica y biolog’a computacional-Teor’a de grafos y redes complejas
